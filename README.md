**Notes**:

1. The majority of GotGreek's code has been merged into
   [BabelFrog](http://github.com/dergachev/babelfrog) with some bug fixes and
   more features.
1. GotGreek uses the [Google Translate API](https://developers.google.com/translate/)
   through my personal credentials which has a 1,700 characters/day limit. So if you
   want to actively use such a translator, again, see [BabelFrog](http://github.com/dergachev/babelfrog).

What is it?
=========

GotGreek is a [bookmarklet](http://marklets.com/FAQ.aspx#whatsABookmarklet) that
provides word or phrase translations as tooltips. Running the bookmarklet activates
GotGreek which will provide a translation tooltip anytime the user selects some text,
or clicks on a word.

Dev Notes:
=========
1. All language codes, see `gotGreek.config.source` and `gotGreek.config.target`,
   must be in compliance with [ISO 639-1](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
   for Google Translate to respond correctly.
1. GotGreek tries to detect source language from attributes of the `html` element
   (`lang` or `xml:lang`) with French as default fallback. Similarly, target 
   language is detected from `navigator` settings with English as default fallback.
1. Consequently, if the target HTML element has its `lang` attribute set to a
   non-standard value, GotGreek fails.
1. If the HTTP response that delivers the site contains the `Content-Security-Policy`
   HTTP header (see
   [Content SecurityPolicy](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy)),
   depending on the browser, GotGreek might fail to inject its dependencies.
   [Facebook](//www.facebook.com) and [GitHub](//www.github.com) are examples.
1. `Yepnope.js` does not set the `type` attribute in the `script` tags it injects.
   Since `type` was mandatory in HTML verions upto 4 and in XHTML, depending on the browser,
   GotGreek might crash.
1. GotGreek uses the existing `jQuery` object if one exists. In cases where the
   `jQuery` variable in the global scope points to an arbitrary object (could be a 
   peculiarly patched version of jQuery), GotGreek will crash.
1. `gotGreek.config.usePowerTip` is hardcoded to `false`. Setting it to `true`,
   will cause toolips to be generated by [PowerTip](http://stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/).
1. However, with PowerTip enabled, GotGreek might crash on some sites:
   1. Some sites, for example [LeMonde](http://www.lemonde.fr), assign `$` to
      to something but `jQuery` which causes `jquery.powertip.js` to not
      bind `powerTip()` to `jQuery.prototype`.
   1. Some sites, for example [LaPresse](http://www.lapresse.ca), ship with versions
      of JavaScript older than `1.7.0` which is the minimum requirement for PowerTip.
1. If there happens to be a `script` element in the DOM between the beginning
   and end nodes of user selection, the text that GotGreek translates will
   include the JavaScript code inside the `script` too.
